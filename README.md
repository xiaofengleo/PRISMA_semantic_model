# PRISMA_semantic_model
FAIR semantic model for PRISMA studies

In the Netherlands, women aged 50-75 years are invited to receive breast cancer screening every two years. 
The PRISMA (Personalised RISk-based MAmmascreening) study was designed to investigate the added value of risk-based mammography screening. 
There is no universally accepted data model for the collection of breast cancer risk factors.
This lack of interoperability would impede the clear data representation and communication globally.

# Objectives
To reduce ambiguity of data schemas in the domain and increase secondary use of patient-reported outcomes through FAIRification, i.e. ensuring data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. 
To create a semantic data model out of the PRISMA questionnaire. 

# Methods
A step-wise and iterative approach was adopted to identify the 67 data elements, and organized them into 15 main classes. 
We applied the Semantic Science Integrated Ontology (SIO), which is capable of modelling entities, processes, and their qualities/attributes, as guidance to derive our core model. 

43,000 screened women completed a web-based questionnaire consist of 211 questions comprising established risk factors and PROMs for breast cancer. 
188 ID(Variables) were identified from the questionnaire. and were mapped to existing ontologies. 
67 common data elements were determined and grouped into 15 main classes.
The Semantic Science Integrated Ontology (SIO), which is capable of modelling entities, processes, and their qualities/attributes, was used to derive the core model, which connect the questions and answers in one framework.

# Results
The questions can be modelled as a type of process and the answers can be modelled as the processâ€™s output. 
67 data elements were identified and grouped into 15 main classes, and mapped to common ontologies to improve its findability and interoperability.
A unified modelling of the questions and answers was established via applying the Semantic Science Integrated Ontology. 
The data model developed could serve as a template for other breast cancer research groups to other Patient-Reported Outcome and Real-World Experience questionnaires.
